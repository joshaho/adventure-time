Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races.

A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"156\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Infernal Master.</span></span> <p>Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves.

It is this uncanny presence from beyond death that allows a scarecrow to inspire fear in those it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind scarecrows with the spirits of demons, but any evil spirit will do. Although aspects of the spirit's personality might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the memories it had as a creature, and its will is focused solely on serving its creator. If its creator dies, the spirit inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to follow its last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or destroys itself.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"race":"","type":"construct","environment":"Grassland","cr":1,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM","class":{}},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str"},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int"},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis"}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"understands the languages of its creator but can't speak"},"di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["custom"],"custom":"bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks"},"dv":{"value":["fire"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","exhaustion","frightened","paralyzed","poisoned","unconscious"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"75S79FEq4RZWun4b","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"https://5e.tools/img/bestiary%2FMM%2FScarecrow.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Scarecrow","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Scarecrow.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"2z2RVKHJCPAstbwu","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"mgihZAwbyNmdePrD","flags":{},"name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mailed-fist.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The scarecrow makes two claw attacks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MM","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":100000},{"_id":"t21NI7vC5MMVRzM1","flags":{},"name":"Claw","type":"weapon","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/sword-brandish.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+3]] (+3) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 6 ([[/r 2d4 + 1]]) slashing damage.

In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.</p><p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon.

By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will.

nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"230\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"231\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano.

She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.

She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\"

You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1059\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting</span></span>\n<p>You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1060\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tools Required</span></span>\n<p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools.

You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,4\">chapter 5</a>, \"Equipment,\" in the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"1061\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Magic of Artifice</span></span>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\">cure wounds</a> using <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#alchemist's%20supplies_phb\">alchemist's supplies</a>, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using <a href=\"https://5e.tools/items.html#tinker's%20tools_phb\">tinker's tools</a>, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#poison%20spray_phb\">poison spray</a>, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\">cure wounds</a> with <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#heat%20metal_phb\">heat metal</a>, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1062\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</span></span>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1063\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Preparing and Casting Spells</span></span>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:artificer=1\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#cure%20wounds_phb\">cure wounds</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1064\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Ability</span></span>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p>\n<p>Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.</p>\n<div class=\"float-clear\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1069\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Infusing an Item</span></span>\n<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see \"Attunement\" in chapter 7 of the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>).</p>\n<p>Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p>You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1070\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Artificer Specialist</span></span>\n<p>At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class's description.

However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery.

It does this using the imprisonment spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"390\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Death and Restoration.</span></span> <p>When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind.

Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"267\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Military Legions.</span></span> <p>Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"268\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Strategic Thinkers.</span></span> <p>Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"269\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beast Trainers.</span></span> <p>Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"270\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Conquer and Control.</span></span> <p>Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.</p><p>Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"271\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Legion of Maglubiyet.</span></span> <p>Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron.</p><div

Its individual storage compartments can leak, providing drinkable liquids with a unique but mostly safe flavor.

Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"198\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gruesome Gluttons.</span></span> <p>Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones.

Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"200\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Legendary Stupidity.</span></span> <p>Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"201\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primitive Wanderers.</span></span> <p>Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons.

However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves.

Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"race":"","type":"swarm of tiny beasts","environment":"Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Swamp, Underdark, Urban","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"MM","class":{}},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"passive":8},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"passive":6},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"passive":5},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"passive":8},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"passive":5},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"passive":8},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"passive":8},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"passive":5},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-5,"passive":5},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"passive":8}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"blindsight 10 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["bludgeoning","piercing","slashing"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened","grappled","paralyzed","petrified","prone","restrained","stunned"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"75S79FEq4RZWun4b","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Swarm of Insects.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Swarm of Insects","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Swarm of Insects.png","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"fd9es28jcxrGA5fo","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"BEpySlviPYNZtaZb","flags":{},"name":"Bites","type":"weapon","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/sword-brandish.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+3]] (+3) to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. <i>Hit:</i> 10 ([[/r 4d4]]) piercing damage, or 5 ([[/r 2d4]]) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MM","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":null,"attuned":false,"equipped":true,"rarity":"","identified":false,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":0,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":"dex","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[["4d4","piercing"],["2d4","piercing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"weaponType":"natural","properties":{},"proficient":true},"sort":100000},{"_id":"52J062wZ8GYvWghW","flags":{},"name":"Swarm","type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect.

This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's creator.</p><p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p><p>A golem can't think or act for itself.

and forests of our wonderful world.&nbsp; Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.&nbsp; Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.&nbsp; This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.&nbsp; WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.&nbsp; When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.&nbsp; It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.&nbsp; Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.&nbsp; The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view.

When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies.

Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"183\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">King of Good Dragons.</span></span> <p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items.

Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death. These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns. When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures.

They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"344\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Infernal Hierarchy.</span></span> <div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.</p><p>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength.

Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.</p><p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.</p><p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><caption>Infernal Hierarchy</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Rank</th><th class=\"col-8\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Devil(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4\"  >1.</td><td class=\"col-8\"  >lemure</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4\"  >2.

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"170\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Patient Predators.</span></span> <p>Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal.

Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity","environment":"Underdark","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"MM","class":{}},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":2,"passive":12},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"passive":7},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"passive":7},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"passive":7},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"passive":7},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"passive":5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"passive":11},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"lg","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"75S79FEq4RZWun4b","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"https://5e.tools/img/bestiary%2FMM%2FCarrion%20Crawler.jpg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Carrion Crawler","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Carrion Crawler.png","width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"uojAQ1Zy3VEIaji5","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"M5Ivz0EUUIUBex9X","flags":{},"name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mailed-fist.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The carrion crawler makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bite.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MM","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":100000},{"_id":"GZADxB8hhoFmltL5","flags":{},"name":"Tentacles","type":"weapon","img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/sword-brandish.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+8]] (+8) to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <i>Hit:</i> 4 ([[/r 1d4 + 2]]) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC <span class=\"rd__dc\">13</span> Constitution saving throw or be <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#poisoned_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'poisoned_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >poisoned</a> for 1 minute.

A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"226\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Living Treasures.</span></span> <p>A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"227\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Green Dragon's Lair.</span></span> <p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.</p><p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"228\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Chromatic Dragons.</span></span> <p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"229\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Driven by Greed.</span></span> <p> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"230\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Ego.</span></span> <p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"231\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dangerous Lairs.</span></span> <p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"232\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Queen of Evil Dragons.</span></span> <p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.</p><p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p></div></div><p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.</p><p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.</p><p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p><p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.</p><p>Dragon Age Categories</p><table class=\" striped-odd\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4\"

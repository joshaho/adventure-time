They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

planet.&nbsp; Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.&nbsp; This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they’ve eaten, and even where they’ve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.&nbsp; WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.&nbsp; When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.&nbsp; It’s quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.&nbsp; Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.&nbsp; The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.&nbsp; We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the camp’s rations for the next month.<br><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.&nbsp; Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.&nbsp; Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.&nbsp; Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.&nbsp; The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin’s chaotic politics.&nbsp; All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.&nbsp; If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.&nbsp;</strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).&nbsp; Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.&nbsp; Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.&nbsp; It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.&nbsp; Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.&nbsp; WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.&nbsp; Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair’s heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.&nbsp; They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.&nbsp; This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.&nbsp; Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.&nbsp; Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;
